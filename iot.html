                    <p id="right-flex" ; style="color:rgb(3, 116, 124)"></br>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a
                        network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items that are embedded with
                        sensors, software, and connectivity. These devices can interact and exchange data with each
                        other, enabling the creation of a smart and interconnected world.
                        </br>Examples: </p>
                    <ul id="right-list" ; style="color:rgb(3, 116, 124)">
                        <li>Google assistant/ Smart speakers</li>
                        <li>Philips Hue bulbs</li>
                        <li>Remote Central Climate Controls based on sensors</li>
                        <li>Smart Watches</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p id="right-flex"></br>For indoor planting, IoT makes monitoring and management of micro-climate
                    conditions a reality, which in turn increases production. For outside planting, devices using IoT
                    technology can sense soil moisture and nutrients, in conjunction with weather data, better control
                    smart irrigation and fertilizer systems. If the sprinkler systems dispense water only when needed,
                    for example, this prevents wasting a precious resource.</p>

            <p id="center-flex">IoT applications in smart buildings provide an efficient and intelligent way of managing
                the energy consumption of a building, resulting in reduced costs and increased sustainability. One of
                the most significant benefits of IoT in smart buildings is the ability to monitor and control various
                systems remotely. For example, building managers can use IoT sensors to monitor temperature, humidity,
                and occupancy levels in real-time, allowing them to make informed decisions about heating, cooling, and
                lighting. IoT systems can also be used to monitor and control other building systems such as elevators,
                lighting, and security.</p>
            <p id="center-flex">Another key benefit of IoT applications in smart buildings is the ability to improve
                safety and security. IoT sensors can be used to monitor and detect hazards such as gas leaks or fire,
                alerting building managers and occupants in real-time. Additionally, IoT technology can be used to
                monitor and control building access, ensuring that only authorized individuals can enter the building or
                specific areas within the building. This can help prevent unauthorized access, theft, or vandalism. IoT
                systems can also be used to monitor and track the movement of people and assets within the building,
                providing valuable insights for building managers.</p>
